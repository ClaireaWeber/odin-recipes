    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Victoria sponge cake is a traditional British layer cake that was once beloved by Queen Victoria. This classic dessert is made with slabs of fluffy sponge cake smothered with layers of strawberry jam and dollops of whipped cream. It is a simple treat but one that is loved by many.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup butter or margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk, room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li> Sift flour and baking powder into a medium bowl and set aside</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla. Add flour mixture in batches, alternating with milk, mixing batter briefly after each addition just to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour better into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
