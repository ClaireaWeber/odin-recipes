Welcome to my first official project. This project is going to be a basic recipe website to find and read different recipes.

This project will increase my comfort in building a bare-boned HTML website structure. It will also help me navigate Github more confidently. The finished project will also be the first official project in my portfolio. Once the website is completed, I will return to this section to write a reflection on the skills I have used and what this project has taught me.

I have just completed the website and it was a lot of fun. While I still don't have a great grasp of Github, I feel a bit more confident navigating it. I also feel more confident building and linking pages using HTML.
